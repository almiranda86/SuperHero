<b>The Super Hero Project:</b>
<br />
Here, the main idea is to use this open api, https://superheroapi.com/index.html, to create the same application with different technologies.
<br />
<b>The objective:</b>
Gain experience by doing a real project in the best way possible, with my current knowledge at the moment.


<b>Tech:</b>
For now, all the development will be focused on the Back-end.
<br />
So, I'm aiming to develop with:<br />

[C#](Backend/C#/README.md)<br />
Java<br />
Go<br />

<b>Next Steps:</b><br />
Add Front-end, with React and Angular<br />
Add Mobile, with Kotlin Multi-Platform
