The Super Hero Project
Here, the main idea is to use https://superheroapi.com/index.html and create the same application, with different technologies, to gain experience by doing a small API consumption project, and maybe some gamification too.

At this moment all the development will be focused on the Back-end.
For this, I'm aiming to develop with:

C#
Java
Go

Next Steps:
Add Front-end, with React and Angular
Add Mobile, with Kotlin Multi-Platform
