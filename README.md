**The Super Hero Project:**<br /><br />
Hello there!<br />

Well, with this project, my main goal is to use this open api, https://superheroapi.com/index.html, and create the same application with different technologies.
<br /><br />
**Why?**<br />
Well, we only gain XP and level up if we do some quests and slay some dragons, huh?!<br />

So, my way to achieve that was by challenging myself to do something, which looks like a real project in the best way possible, with my current knowledge at the moment.


**Tech:**<br />
The real objective is to develop it in a full-stack way, meaning:<br />
back-end, front-end, ci/cd, and everything else which may sound necessary<br />

But for now, all the development will be focused on the Back-end, which, I'm aiming to develop with:<br />
[C#](https://github.com/almiranda86/SuperHero/blob/48a7dbd43ba5c7e72854ff6b23b56dd69501daaf/Backend/C%23/README.md)<br />
Java<br />
Go<br />
Typescript<br /><br />

Add Front-end, with React and Angular<br />
Add Mobile, with Kotlin Multi-Platform<br />
Check about K8S and GitHub actions for CI/CD

Well, I guess for now, this is all I have to say!<br />
Let's see how it goes, hoping not to drive me crazy in the process<br />
