<b>The Super Hero Project:</b>
<br />
Here, the main idea is to use this open api, https://superheroapi.com/index.html, to create the same application with different technologies.
<br />
<b>The objective:</b>
Gain experience by doing a real project in the best way possible, with my current knowledge at the moment.


<b>Tech:</b>
For now, all the development will be focused on the Back-end.
<br />
So, I'm aiming to develop with:<br />

Java<br />
Go<br />
