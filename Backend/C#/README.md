<b>C# Version for SuperHero Project</b><br />

As C# is my main tech stack, I've decided to start with it.<br />
I've chosen an approach that segregates the responsibilities through N projects, including the one I named IoC, where I've put all the Dependency Injection, and later referenced only it in the API main project.
